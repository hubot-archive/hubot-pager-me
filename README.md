# hubot-pager-me

PagerDuty integration for Hubot

## Installation

In your hubot repository, run:

`npm install hubot-pager-me --save`

Then add **hubot-pager-me** to your `external-scripts.json`:

```json
["hubot-pager-me"]
```

## Configuration

`pager me` requires a bit of configuration to get everything working:

* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_SUBDOMAIN - Your account subdomain
* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_USER_ID - The user id of a PagerDuty user for your bot. This is only required if you want chat users to be able to trigger incidents without their own PagerDuty user
* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_API_KEY - Get one from https://<your subdomain>.pagerduty.com/api_keys
* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_SERVICE_API_KEY - Service API Key from a 'General API Service'. This should be assigned to a dummy escalation policy that doesn't actually notify, as hubot will trigger on this before reassigning it
* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_SERVICES - (optional) Provide a comma separated list of service identifiers (e.g. `PFGPBFY`) to restrict queries to only those services.
* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_CHAR_TO_SPACE - (optional) Provide a character that will be transformed into a space. For example, if you specify `_` here then entering something like `pager trigger Foo_Bar testing` will transform the schedule to `Foo Bar`.

### Webhook

Using a webhook requires a bit more configuration:

* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_ENDPOINT - Pagerduty Webhook listener e.g /hook
* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_ROOM - Room in which you want the pagerduty webhook notifications to appear

To setup the webhooks and get the alerts in your chatrooms, you need to add the endpoint you define here (e.g /hooks) in
the service settings of your Pagerduty accounts. You also need to define the room in which you want them to appear.
(Unless you want to spam all the rooms with alerts, but we don't believe that should be the default behavior :)  

## Example interactions

Trigger an incident assigned to a specific user:

```
technicalpickles> hubotjpager trigger jnewland omgwtfbbq
hubot> technicalpickles: :pager: triggered! now assigning it to the right user...
hubot> technicalpickles: :pager: assigned to jnewland!
```

Trigger an incident assigned to an escalation policy:


```
technicalpickles> hubot pager trigger ops site is down
hubot> Shell: :pager: triggered! now assigning it to the right user...
hubot> Shell: :pager: assigned to ops!
```

Check on open incidents:

```
technicalpickles> hubot pager sup
hubot>
      Triggered:
      ----------
      8: 2014-11-05T20:17:50Z site is down - @technicalpickles - assigned to jnewland

      Acknowledged:
      -------------
      7: 2014-11-05T20:16:29Z omgwtfbbq - @technicalpickles - assigned to jnewland
```

Acknowledge triggered alerts assigned to you:

```
jnewland> /pager ack
hubot> jnewland: Incident 9 acknowledged
```

Resolve acknowledged alerts assigned to you:

```
jnewland> /pager resolve
hubot> jnewland: Incident 9 resolved
```

Check up coming schedule, and schedule shift overrides on it:

```
technicalpickles> hubot pager schedules
hubot> * Ops - https://urcompany.pagerduty.com/schedules#DEADBEE
technicalpickles> hubot pager schedule ops
hubot> * 2014-06-24T09:06:45-07:00 - 2014-06-25T03:00:00-07:00 technicalpickles
       * 2014-06-25T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-26T03:00:00-07:00 jnewland
       * 2014-06-26T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-27T03:00:00-07:00 technicalpickles
       * 2014-06-27T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-28T03:00:00-07:00 jnewland
       * 2014-06-28T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-29T03:00:00-07:00 technicalpickles
technicalpickles> hubot pager override ops 2014-06-25T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-26T03:00:00-07:00 chrislundquist
hubot> Override setup! chrislundquist has the pager from 2014-06-25T06:00:00-04:00 until 2014-06-26T06:00:00-04:00
technicalpickles> hubot pager schedule
hubot> * 2014-06-24T09:06:45-07:00 - 2014-06-25T03:00:00-07:00 technicalpickles
       * 2014-06-25T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-26T03:00:00-07:00 chrislundquist
       * 2014-06-26T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-27T03:00:00-07:00 technicalpickles
       * 2014-06-27T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-28T03:00:00-07:00 jnewland
       * 2014-06-28T03:00:00-07:00 - 2014-06-29T03:00:00-07:00 technicalpickles
```

## Conventions

hubot-pager-me makes some assumptions about how you are using PagerDuty:

* PagerDuty email matches chat email
  * override with `hubot pager me as <pagerduty email>`
* Schedules' and Escalation Policies' names are letters, numbers, dashes and underscores. Spaces are also possible with `HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_CHAR_TO_SPACE`
* The Service used by hubot-pager-me should not be assigned to an escalation policy with real people on it. Instead, it should be a dummy user that doesn't have any notification rules. If this isn't done, the escalation policy assigned to it will be notified, and then hubot will immediately reassign to the proper team

## Development

Fork this repository, and clone it locally. To start using with an existing hubot for testing:

* Run `npm install` in hubot-pager-me repository
* Run `npm link` in hubot-pager-me repository
* Run `npm link hubot-pager-me` in your hubot directory
* NOTE: if you are using something like [nodenv](https://github.com/wfarr/nodenv) or similar, make sure your `npm link` from the same node version

There's a few environment variables useful for testing:

* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_NOOP: don't actually make POST/PUT HTTP requests
* HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_TEST_EMAIL: force email of address to this for testing
